# MernStack-
This repository includes a variety of MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack projects I've worked on to practice and demonstrate full-stack web development. Each project covers essential features such as authentication, CRUD operations, real-time communication, RESTful APIs, and more.
